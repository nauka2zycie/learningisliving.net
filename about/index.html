<h1>About...</h1>
<p>
</p>
<h1 id="me">&hellip;me</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m a researcher and learning enthusiast originally from Germany since having moved abroad, currently in the end stages of my PhD.
On this website and on the wider internet I go by Nauka, although this is not my real name.</p>
<p>This site is meant to be a place distinct from my professional or private identity to allow for more casual and experimental content, so I would ask you to stick to the pseudonym when commenting or referring to this side.
That being said, I&rsquo;m not planning to publish stories based on  embellishing confidential information form <em>nor</em> is there evidence of me harboring sympathies for scientific racists and neo-nazis, so my real identity is not a secret, and I will not delete this site nor send a mob towards anyone referring to me by my clearname <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I&rsquo;m, simply asking you politely to help me keep this separation.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>:
While I am trying to control the pathos in my writing, but often fail. If I do and for any feedback/advice, please feel free to reach out via mail at contact at this websites URL.</p>
<h1 id="this-website">&hellip;this website</h1>
<p>I would like my website to serve two purposes</p>
<ul>
<li>a public platform to share my writings and other projects</li>
<li>a private meta-structure imposed on my projects to help me order my thoughts and have them placed into a larger whole that I can incrementally grow and refine.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.gwern.net/About">Gwern.net</a>, <a href="https://matt.might.net/">matt.might.net</a> and other researchers I admire.</p>
<h2 id="current-design-intentions">Current design intentions</h2>
<p>The idea is that things move from the (private) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> style pile of notes and documents (that I <em>might</em> share once I am more confident to help people like me who struggle with <a href="https://livingislearning.net/blog/threepartsonanxiety/">anxiety</a> and impostor syndrome realise that the mess is okay and can be part of a process) into the public <a href="https://livingislearning.net/blog/">blog</a> section once they are polished enough to enjoyable reads but don&rsquo;t yet meet serious intellectual rigor standards, then move into a more detailed research 
 section which functions as proto-papers and finally (hopefully) results in an  artifact 
 that is some useful, standalone piece of writing, software, a peer-reviewed publication etc.</p>
<p>By having the whole process in form of a website I&rsquo;m tinkering on I hope to hack one of my maladaptive coping mechanism of bouncing around projects and procrastination. I&rsquo;m setting this up in october <del>2021</del> 2022 
 and will do a review blog post a year afterwards which I&rsquo;ll link here, which is also when I&rsquo;ll update this section. This is an experiment for me, but I&rsquo;m as excited about it as I&rsquo;ve rarely been.</p>
<p><strong>Update from 2022:</strong> Well, this went interestingly. The update post will be me writing the actual &ldquo;how I made my website&rdquo; post once I have had time to edit it. Basically, the system <em>worked</em>, but one of the things I ended up not procrastinating on was&hellip;working on the website for a year. So I guess, mission accomplished, task ignored.</p>
<p>What I did do is detailed in <a href="https://livingislearning.net/blog/what_i_did_instead_of_making_a_website/">this blog post</a></p>
<h1 id="my-interests">&hellip;my interests</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in complex adaptive systems, especially economies, political and social systems.
To study them, I try to use three lenses</p>
<ul>
<li>mathematical methods rooted in ML and optimisation theory. Here I have an academic education and professional background, particularly in generative models for graphs and sets, reinforcement learning and game theory.</li>
<li>a media criticism and philosophical lens, where I mainly hew to post-modern and infinitist approaches</li>
<li>a historical lens, where I tend to historical <a href="materialism">materialism</a>, annals and peoples history</li>
</ul>

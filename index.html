        I am currently trying to finish up two long form writeups, but would like to update this blog more often, so I will start a new category: media reviews. Short to not so short summaries of what I liked about a given piece of media - books, movies, papers, YouTube videos etc. Without further ado, let’s start.
I have just finished listening to the latest video of Kraut which both introduces and attempts to debunk the internal relations framework of realism, i.

        This is a copy of the the index for this series.
As my research takes a final pivot over into the land of combinatorial optimisation with a colleague I figured it might be a nice idea to do an advent calendar of blog posts about combinatorial optimisation An idea which I’m of course shamelessly cribbing from the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">https://adventofcode.com/</a>  .
Since I have deadlines to hit, I will have to do this economically so I’m counting this announcement and creating the outline and initial research as the first day.

        It’s 2023 and my Ph.D. is coming to a close. Despite having an impostor syndrome like all good academics, I am trying to be more honest about my skills and achievments instead of downplaying them.
This post is me practicing this.
So despite it feeling really awkward, I do think that I am inching towards living up to one of my favourite aphorisms:
Jack of all trades, master of none - certainly better than a master of one

        I started working on this website in September of 2021, when I was really struggling during my PhD. I was in the process of getting some mental health diagnoses done and was all over the place mentally - changing labs and topics during COVID19 does not make for the most productivity enhancing start.
Working on the website was the first step of tying together all the strewn subprojects I had done over the last 5 years and slowly start organising myself as well.

Today we do the first deeper dive into technical details of a method. And given its ubiquity, I think it’s a good thing to start with the lingua franca of combinatorial optimization: Linear programming.

        Yesterday I tried to give you a quick intuition on what optimization in general and combinatorial optimization in particular are, as well as hint a bit at the historical developments that brought them to the current form. Today I want to go a bit deeper on this. I should note this specific perspective on the timeline is my own - and thus you might want to compare and contrast with more venerable thinkers in the field, like Prof.

        What is optimization?  What do we optimize?  Why would optimising on a finite set be more difficult than on an infinite set?  Edit from the future: I got covid on day 4 of writing this, which means I will move the schedule to “as soon as done”.
What is combinatorial optimization? Prof. Schrijver (Schrijver 2003) concisely summarizes it as
Combinatorial optimization searches for an optimum object in a finite collection of objects.

        I just received a letter from the Swiss Government telling me that my 5 years of PhD do not count towards the Permis C, according to the rules laid out here on page 22. I had originally taken his to mean that the PhD counts as normal employment, which as an EU citizen means I would be able to ask for the Permis C. This would mean I’d have some security of staying in the country (allowing for startup and other ventures that a normal employment might not permit), as well as taking my first steps towards the citizenship.

        I have pretty bad impostor syndrome.
For a long time I’ve thought about intellectual work, of creative work, of entrepreneurship as something that only very talented people did, not me. I’ve always thought about myself as more of a reader, learner, tinkerer and fixer than a doer, finder,creator and performer.
Let’s talk about impostor syndrome and how I’m trying to overcome it it.
Other people First, back to the talented people.
